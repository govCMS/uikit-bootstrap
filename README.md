# UI-Kit Bootstrap

## DTA UI-Kit Bootstrap Theme

An ever evolving drop-in Bootstrap v3 stylesheet in the style of the Australian Government [DTA Design Guide &amp; UI-Kit](https://github.com/govau/uikit/).

Using Boostrap classes where ever possible, with a small number of extra classes to use some elements which had no Bootstrap equivalent.

Latest styles from DTA [here](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/)

* Currently just compiling Sass via CodeKit (v3).*

* Will use Gulp when added into actual theme - such as [govstrap theme](https://github.com/govCMS/govstrap)*

Forked from https://github.com/fribibb/DTOstrap (27 October 2017)
